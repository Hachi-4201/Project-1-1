<h3> 
In English we needed to write about objects that meant a lot to us, 
objects of ours that had some sort of history or even ones that we didnt have yet.
I used my first one as an example, I wrote about my old graphics card that used to be in my computer.
I was really blurry on most of the details so I had to make some elements up, it had to be similar to a mentor text 
that we had next to it, sort of like a guideline.

<h3>
This Project has taught me how to use mentor texts to shape stories.
I actually really enjoyed this project, I liked being able to write about more personal things.
Using mentor texts to create stories will definetly help me in college, so I am glad I got to 
work on that with this project.
