<h3> 
In Graphic Communications we had to interview a partner and ask them questions about their life, questions like,
"whats your favoirte subject?" "what do you think the biggest issue in the world is?". Questions that will show someones personality.
We also needed to take pictures of our partner, I took around 8 pictures of Julie, but I choose that one because
It showed depth and overlapping elements.  
</h3>

<h3>
This Project has taught me the basics of interviewing a skill I didn't have before because I had never done one before
so this was an interesting experience.
Interviewing is probably going to pop up again later in my life, so I'm glad im getting a head start(kinda)
