<h3> 
In Algebra 2 we all needed to create a box with linear equations.
It needed to be a rectangle and be animated with a variable. 
Domain and Range were the main factors of of these equations, the domian and range
are what determine where the line starts and ends in either the x or y. 
So it makes sense that almost every equation I have has a Domain. 
</h3>

<h3>
This Project was about using domain and range in linear functions, I was pretty unclear on domain and range 
but the project actually helped me understand them a lot stronger. 
Domain and Range are a vital part of Algebra, which will later turn into Calculus so knowing these things are very important.
