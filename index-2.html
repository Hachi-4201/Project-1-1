<h3> 
In Chemistry, we've been learning about scale, but more than weight; large scale, small scale 
and the differences in scale between our world and the universe. 
For our project, we had to create a powerpoint or story
about the origins of our universe based on evidence and religion.
We decided to make a skit which still met the requirments.

<h3>
This Project has freshed up my knowledge of the big bang, I was a tad bit fuzzy going in to this
but I learned everything I needed to know.
Knowing all of the creation theroies is helpful in science so I will definently apply what I learned here in the future.
