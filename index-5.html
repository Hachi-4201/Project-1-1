<h3> 
In World History we have been learning about the revolutions of the late 18th century. This included: 
The French, Haitan ad Latin-American Revolutions. So the project itself was a DBQ and we needed to list the reasons why 
the revolutions were even started.
</h3>

<h3>
This Project taught me about a revolution that I had not known very much about, The Haitian Revolution.
Im about 50% Haitan so this is pretty important for me and im glad I learned about it, but that wasn't what the whole project was
The Project was a DBQ about The Latin, French and Haitian Revolutions.
The skills for writing a DBQ is very important for college so it's pretty great that I'm writing them now.
